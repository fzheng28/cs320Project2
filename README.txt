In this project, your goal is to make a new module, bus, to help people analyze the Madison Metro system. Making a module is a little different than making a notebook. We won't be asking you a single question, but you'll need to make sure your module follows our spec -- it needs to have the EXACT classes required, and the methods in those class will need to behave as intended.

A few key features of your module:

- search for bus trips by route
- quickly search for bus stops in a rectangle or circle (using a binary tree)
- identify trips on which passengers may bring bikes
- visualize stops, distinguishing which ones are wheelchair accessible
- compare weekend service to weekday service
